## Udacity

My solution for Udacity assignments and projects (excluding Deep Learning projects).  
Udacity course: [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd009/syllabus/core-curriculum)


This repo doesn't contain datasets. Therefore, you need to download it from somewhere else. It's quite easy to find these datasets.

I have updated sklearn version to 0.19.0. The main repository from udacity is still using sklearn 0.17.0. Therefore, there might be some differences between both repos.

### Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
